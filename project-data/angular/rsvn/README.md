# Rsvn

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.15.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Upgrade

Run `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core` to upgrade Angular and Angular CLI.  After those have been upgraded you can upgrade it's dependents like NgRX (`ng update @ngrx/store`), Angular Material (`ng update @angular/material`), and Bootstrap (`ng update @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap`).  

It's important to verify every update with a new build since sometimes the Angular Cli can miss updating related packages, among other compatibility things.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
